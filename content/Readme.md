Hi, I'm Aarushi — though many just call me Kalia (yep, like it's my superhero alias).

I stroll — no, _meander_ — through life with my curiosity on a leash that’s way too long. One moment I’m neck-deep in code or some obscure tech rabbit hole, and the next I’m rewinding a film scene because the cinematography made my spine tingle. Music? Don’t even get me started — I can go from Mozart to Mitski faster than you can say “shuffle.”

I don’t believe in staying in one lane. I zigzag between disciplines like a kid in a candy store, wide-eyed and insatiably curious. I ask too many questions, chase too many ideas, and somehow, that’s exactly where I thrive.

I’m a thinker, a feeler, a chronic over-analyzer, and someone who could probably host a TED Talk on the art of spiraling (but make it intellectual). If you’re into deep dives, spontaneous rants about storytelling in cinema, or existential debates over chai — we’ll get along just fine.
